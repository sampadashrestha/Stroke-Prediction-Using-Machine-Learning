# Stroke-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
- Developed predictive models to assess stroke risk using real-world medical datasets.
- Implemented machine learning techniques like Random Forest and Feedforward Neural Networks.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score.
- Conducted data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize results
using R Studio and Python.
- Used libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Optuna, RandomizedSearchCV
